    <h1>Reflection</h1>
     <p>I love being innovative and never teaching the same way twice. Keeping this portfolio will encourage me to continue to try new things and document them along the way. It is also a great way for me to reflect on my teaching practices and remember things that worked well and learn from things that didnâ€™t go as planned. I hope to inspire others with my work, but most importantly continue to challenge myself and be a better teacher every year for my students.</p>
    <p>So far in my Master's degree program I have learned how to code a website and write an action research plan. To my surprise the coding was the hardest part! I have learned so many things about what goes into creating a website, I have so much more respect for people who create them themselves. Now when I do coding with my students on International Hour of Code week I can show them that I know a few things about coding and can even show them the website I created.</p>
    <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
    <blockquote>I believe all students are naturally curious. I believe in guiding students to be seekers of knowledge by showing them how to use tools to find answers to their questions and solutions to their problems. I believe in encouraging scholars to take charge of their own education, become life long learners and innovative digital citizens.</blockquote>
