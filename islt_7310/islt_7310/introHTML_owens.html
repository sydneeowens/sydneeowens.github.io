  Hello, my name is Sydnee Owens. I graduated from UMKC’s Institute for Urban Education program in 2016 with a bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education. For the past four years I have taught at a Kansas City charter school. This year I am starting at a year round school in the North Kansas City School District. I am currently in my first semester of my Master’s in Learning Technologies and Design with a Technology in Schools emphasis. I love teaching with technology and I love trying new things, however I will say this coding thing is not coming easy to me! I hope to learn some things that I will be able to apply in my 3rd grade classroom. In my free time, I love reading, watching movies and spending time with friends and family. I’m looking forward to traveling and going to concerts and sporting events again soon hopefully!
