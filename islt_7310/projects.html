<section id="project1"><h3>Project #1: The Flipped Classroom</h3></section>
    <p>Flipping my classroom is something I decided to do back in 2018 (long before all this distance learning started!) so I could effectively meet the needs of ALL learners in my classroom. I broke each concept into "levels" to gamify my classroom as well, so the objective was to MASTER the concept. Each level was a different depth of knowledge level. Students can move at their own pace throughout the levels and my job is to facilitate and help where/when I'm needed. This helps my advanced students because they can fly through the content at their own quick pace without having to wait on the rest of the class. It helps my less advanced students by giving them additional time to work through the content and to ask for help when they feel stuck without everyone having to wait on them. </p>

    <section id="project2"><h3>Project #2: Memes as Expectations</h3></section>
    <p>To review classroom expectations after winter break I had my students create memes to review our classroom and school expectations. I also threw in a little digital citizenship lesson by showing them which images are "free" images that they can use to create something new with. They were shocked to find out that any image on the internet is not free to use! Many of them decided it would be easier to take their own pictures instead of searching on the internet.</p>

    <section id="project3"><h3>Project #3: Mission to Mars</h3></section>
    <p>Mission to Mars is a project I did in 2018 with my students in our Earth's Place in the Universe unit. In the unit, each thing we learned about the Earth and how we are able to live on this planet they had to research and see if it was the same on Mars. Students had to use critical thinking skills to synthesize information about why life is sustainable on Earth and see if it would be possible to sustain life on Mars. There were a lot of current events that involved Mars last year which made this project especially relevant! </p>
    <aside><a href="https://sites.google.com/tolbertacademy.org/missiontomars/home?authuser=0">Mission to Mars Project Website</a></aside>
    <p>Students had to decide why they were going to Mars. They had 3 options to choose from: 1) They wanted to be Astronauts and explore the planet. 2) They wanted to be Pioneers and build a civilization that could survive on Mars. 3) They wanted to be Entrepreneurs and find resources on Mars that they could bring back to Earth and sell. They made an introductory video on Flipgrid to explain their group's mission. See an example of a <a href="https://flipgrid.com/3cc7e068">student video here</a>.</p>
